<p>Designing user interactions for hardware devices have presented the most challenging design problems in my career. This is mostly due to the limited screen space and limited user inputs for both hardware and firmware. Solving design problems for small screens have helped me become a more 
creative UX Designer due to the restrictions imposed on the design.</p>
<p>Thankfully, due to my knowledge of jQuery mobile and CSS3, I have learned to 
create highly interactive and realistic simulations for hardware devices given 
the fact that most small devices are now touch-enabled. My design contributions 
have been especially beneficial for conducting early user testing in a more 
natural environment where users can hold a mobile device and interact with it 
through gestures, and therefore help discover the many user interaction issues that would otherwise not 
have been possible with simpler wireframing tools.  </p>

<h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">HP Printers</h4>

<p>Working at HP presented wonderful opportunities to apply my design knowledge 
and prototyping techniques to designing printer control panels. I was fortunate 
to contribute to the design of a new generation of touch-enabled control panels 
that were released in 2022-2023. My main responsibility was to take the customer 
and business requirements and create more realistic simulations after the Figma 
wireframes had reached their inherent limitations. The HTML and jQuery components shown below are highly modular and are reusable, which significantly helped with 
brainstorming interactive concepts for conducting early user testing. The more 
valid usability test results from high-fidelity prototypes not only helped 
create a better and more user-friendly product, but they also saved a great deal 
of unnecessary costs in product delays and rework.</p>
	<p>The following prototype demonstrates the user journey through control panel setup and connection to the Wi-Fi network. It was imperative to have a very smooth and seamless user interface that would guide the user through each step of the setup process; prevent errors and help users recover from errors, and successfully 
	lead them to print their first page&nbsp;to help build confidence in the product.</p>

<h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Dell Jukebox MP3 Player</h4>

	<p>Dell Jukebox was a major attempt by Dell to enter the consumer 
	market and gain recognition as being more than just a PC manufacturer. 
	Apple&#39;s iPod was at the time the undisputed king of the MP3 players. Any 
	competition had to come up with worthy user-friendly features to attract 
	consumers in a saturated market segment. Dell Jukebox user research also made the 
	company aware that low-cost solutions and price alone could not be the only drivers to gain 
	market share, and that ease of use and design aesthetics were the key 
	differentiations that consumers were willing to pay for. </p>
	<p>Through user research, we actually learned that one of the most important 
	features of iPod was the signature Click Wheel. It was not just the fact 
	that the iPod wheel simplified user interaction and the user navigation, but the enormous 
	ergonomic value to the users by being able to hold the device with one hand and navigate the menus and select songs. So while we could design the menus similar to iPod, we had to 
	create something similar (ergonomically speaking) to iPod functionality.</p>
	<p>As such we came up with the concept of the Thumb Wheel which was placed at the center of the device. Turning the wheel would enable the users to navigate the menus vertically and then pressing it down would select an action such as playing a song. The rest of the buttons for pause/play, and rewind and skip were also placed ergonomically to be within the 
	easy reach of the user's thumb and provide tactile feedback. I also had to work on the software usability for the Jukebox with our supplier in order to make sure that the user could transfer songs easily from the PC to the albums on the device. The player received warm reception in the market for its innovative features and ergonomics.</p>

 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Dell Photo Printers</h4>
 
	
			<p>When I started working for Dell, the User Experience Group 
		conducted user testing on third-party products with virtually no UX Design 
		involvement in the design of the products.&nbsp;We would basically 
			select a vendor based on usability test results. I was hired to help establish 
			interaction Design within usability 
		and help bring more influence and recognition to our group through 
		design involvement. Dell was 
		essentially 
		a hardware company at the time, and the suppliers modified Dell products based on 
		slight cosmetic hardware modifications in order to differentiate the Dell brand. The company was realizing that the success of Apple was 
		largely due to the fact that the Apple User Experience was directly 
		involved in product design, and our group had to respond somehow.</p>
	<p>My first major assignment with the Dell printer product line was to directly work with Lexmark 
	as our printer supplier, 
		and modify their printer control panel user interface to make the Dell brand 
	easier to use and give our printers their own design language. One such 
		product was the Dell 942 printer, the first major attempt to redesign and modify 
		a supplier multifunction printer. The device had to Print, Scan, 
		Copy, and Fax. 
		</p>
	<p>Through user research we learned which direct shortcuts 
		the customers preferred for routine tasks via the buttons on the control 
	panel, rather than having to 
	navigate through 
		the tedious and complicated menus on the LCD screen that had been 
	originally designed by Lexmark. For example, users wanted two separate buttons for printing in color or in black to save money on ink 
	without selecting the color option through a menu. Users also&nbsp; wanted 
	to be able to scan to an application directly (e.g., Microsoft Word or PDF), 
	and select each device function directly via buttons on control panel rather 
	then through menus (for print, copy, fax, and scan). User Experience 
	discovered 
	that a low-cost solution to install fewer buttons and force users to cycle 
	through menus could actually backfire in the market, and as such made better informed 
	design decisions and influenced the product design accordingly. The user research, the design 
		effort, and the A/B usability tests helped the company design its first 
		control panel through interactive mockups before the printer hardware was built 
	(as traditionally had been done), which also provided the firmware and software engineers 
	with a vision to understand the intent of the UX design and build it more quickly. 
	It further helped differentiate the Dell brand because of its user-friendly 
	features, and created a design paradigm for millions of Dell printers sold 
	around the world.</p>
