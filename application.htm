		<p>
		Designing <i>thin client</i> and <i>thick client </i>applications has 
		been a central part of my career. Early in my career I started designing 
		thick client applications for Microsoft Windows. I was a Visual Basic 
		programmer for several years which tremendously helped me with 
		designing rich user interfaces quickly 
		and effectively for operating systems. As the 
		internet evolved, I used my prior Visual Basic experience to adapt to 
		designing client-server applications in HTML and web scripting languages, which ultimately 
		paved the way for designing mobile and responsive applications in the 
		future. These 
		applications were designed for the mass consumer markets as 
		well as for internal corporate use. </p>
<p>
		Given the fact that product design is a 
		continuum, my prototyping skills help evolve the design from simple wireframe 
		concepts to highly interactive designs that represent the information 
		architecture, the interaction design, onscreen animations, and the 
		visual design. </p>
		<p>
		My interactive prototypes have been critically important for demonstrating 
		design concepts to 
		company executives and product owners; for conducing usability 
		inspections and usability tests, and for communicating with product 
		development teams. They have been used for lab and remote user testing, 
		and have saved unnecessary costs by discovering usability issues and missing user requirements 
		early in&nbsp; the design process.</p>
	<p>
		The following case studies serve as a few examples of my design 
		contributions in various industries that are non-proprietary and I can share with you. I have also captured videos to demonstrate the types of high-fidelity 
		interactive prototypes that I create for complex user interactions. </p>

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Customer Support Applications</h4>

					<p>Product design and product support often go hand in hand 
					to create a superior user experience. As part of my 
					responsibilities at Dell, HP, and Iomega, I was asked to help 
					redesign customer support sites to help users with a 
					seamless hardware and software installation experience. I also had&nbsp;to 
					propose better methods for troubleshooting to cut down on 
					product support calls that could wipe out any profit on the sale of 
					our consumer products.</p>
					<p>One of the most recent design challenges that I faced at 
					HP was that our customers often relied on YouTube videos and Google search to install or troubleshoot 
					printers. Many of these videos available on the 
					internet are not created by qualified technicians and often contain 
					major errors which negatively impact 
					the user experience, and ultimately lead to costly customer support 
					calls and a lower NPS score for products. </p>
					<p>The design challenge therefore was to direct users to our 
					product support page to guide the users through proper 
					installation, troubleshooting, and provide learning material 
					all in one place. As such we created a new user journey to 
					address the aforementioned challenges in 3 simple steps.</p>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px">
									<li>Upon unboxing the printer, the 
									Quickstart Guide was simplified to direct 
									the user to the product installation page 
									for a specific printer. Instead of 
									complicated and often confusing 
									illustrations on paper, the user could view 
									a brief video of the product installation, 
									and then navigate through the guided 
									installation steps to install the hardware. 
									Through research we had discovered that 
									installation videos were highly desired by 
									customers, which is why they would often 
									rely on YouTube even if the information was 
									incorrect, and the design addressed this 
									pain point.</li>
									<li>&nbsp;After hardware setup was complete, the 
									user would be guided to put the machine on 
									the home Wi-Fi network.</li>
									<li>&nbsp;The guided installation would then 
									instruct the user to download the correct app 
									to automatically detect 
									the printer model and install it on any 
									device to print, scan, and fax.</li>
					</ul>
					
        <p>This approach was significantly more user-friendly and effective 
		since it helped prevent users from skipping important installation steps 
		and from installing incorrect software, which was not often the case 
		with traditional printed instructions and illustrations that were long 
		and confusing. It also simplified designing for international audience 
		due to ease of translation and communicating with users through 
		animations and videos . </p>
					<p>The following two videos demonstrate the mobile and the 
					desktop versions of my design which I created in HTML. 
					Careful effort was spent on the mobile version since most 
					users preferred to carry a phone with them and refer to the 
					steps while installing their printers.</p>

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Complex Mobile Apps</h4>

		<p>One of the mot significant design challenges that I have faced in 
		recent years is designing for the mobile environment. Small devices are a very taxing design environment since every pixel counts, and are more error prone than the traditional mouse and keyboard. As 
		such I have had to spend many more hours on being creative and working within 
		the limitations of touch-enabled devices, and spending more time to 
		validate those designs with stakeholders and the end users than desktop applications. </p>
					<p>For example, while at Boeing, I designed the company&#39;s first mobile application for airplane certification. 
					<em>Electronic Just in Time Testing</em> empowered airplane technicians to conduct 
					hundreds of functional tests on airplanes and record the 
					test results directly on tablets (rather than writing test 
					results first on paper and then recording them on a PC, thus saving 
					90 hours of labor on average per airplane). Test results would be 
					immediately sent from tablets to a computer and analyzed in real time, which saved the company millions of dollars to immediatley discover and mitigate certification issues.</p>
					<p>While at IBM, I also designed the first app for the sales 
					teams that would immediately alert them to new sales 
					opportunities in various regions, and helped them bid on 
					contracts as soon as they went public. Such an app enhanced the sales teams' situational awareness that positively impacted the top line by generating millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
					<p>The following is an example of such apps that I design and prototype from wireframe (Figma on the right) to high-fidelity (HTML and JavaScript on the left). I  would often send links to such interactive prototypes to my focus groups and subject matter experts to get early feedback, and close the gaps in user requirements while 
					before the A/B user tests were conducted.</p>

<div id="dashboard-section" class="scroll-section" >

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Analytical and Operational Dashboards</h4>

		<p>One of the most difficult design challenges that I tackled while working at 
		Boeing and IBM were projects that involved analytical and 
		operational dashboards. Some were complex in-house applications that 
		required the creation and management of content; approval of tasks in 
		a workflow, and various levels of user access rights. I also had to closely 
		simulate the Tableau user interface and design within its limitations 
		for simpler projects that were designed entirely in Tableau. </p>
		<p>Much of my success in dashboard design projects depended on my ability to show how data was presented and manipulated. HTML provides great flexibility to show data tables; allow users to input data and select from a set of data, and then be presented with charts and other relevant information. Here I could contribute to the full stack by working with back-end and front-end developers to demonstrate how every element of the design functioned.
		</p>
					<p>For example, while working at Boeing, Flight Test Operations required real-time 
		operational dashboards to measure actual performance versus targets. 
		Executives required analytical dashboards to understand what worked and what did not historically. 
		For example:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:30px">
				<li>We needed to gather data in real time to measure how many 
				flight test plans had changed within 24 hours of testing, given the 
				fact that the ideal target was zero.
				</li>
				<li>We had to display how many test airplanes were landing late 
				vs. the planned arrival.</li>
				<li>After the tests, we had to display the analytical data in a way to

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Dell IT Assistant (ITA)</h4>

		<p>Dell ITA was a highly ambitious project which required broad and direct leadership for 
		the full UCD cycle. The company executives were looking for solutions to 
		the following problems: </p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding right: 30px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; ">
	How can we control Dell devices and applications from a centralized console? How 
	can we obtain 
	detailed hardware and software inventory information from a centralized 
	database and identify issues as they happen? How can system administrators create and run scheduled tasks for selected devices and 
	establish dynamic groups of devices? How can we create a role-based and 
	customizable user interface for system administrators?</p>

		<p>The solution would reduce downtime significantly  and  
				and vastly improve system admin productivity. I was tasked with conducting user research initially. System 
		Administrators were interviewed and their goals were documented in 
		detail. Following the Allen Cooper model, I documented what users wanted to <em>see</em> 
		in the user interface and how it should be organized (the information 
		architecture), and what they wanted <em>to do</em> with the interface 
		(the interaction design model). </p>
		<p>Documenting user tasks led me to rely on some of 
		the familiar design metaphors in the Microsoft Windows Human Interface 
		Guidelines, and to take advantage of what the users were already familiar 
		with. The System Administrators could potentially manage hundreds of 
		devices, and the devices had a parent-child nesting relationship and needed 
		bulk actions on a group of devices or direct actions on an individual device. I decided to use a Treeview (aka Windows Explorer)
		control to design the 
		nesting relationship of the devices; tabs for viewing distinct categories of information 
		for each device, and a Listview control to display data in columns. The 
		interface would be highly modular and customizable by the user, and 
		could grow and adapt as more features were added to it in the future. It 
		could also adapt to the user roles and needs: system admins could be 
		assigned any 
		number of devices depending on their user privileges and only monitor those 
		devices. 
		I created my final interactive prototypes in Visual Studio for user testing and for demos 
		to stakeholders and software developers.</p>
			<p>The design met all the 5 objectives of usability: Useful, 
			Learnable, Efficient, Forgiving, and Satisfaying . It has been used to 
			manage millions of Dell servers and other devices since its 
			inception, and is still being perfected by Dell based on my original 
			design concept. This is one of my design contributions that I am most proud of.</p>

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">FiatLux 3D</h4>

		<p>3D Medical Imaging is one of the most interesting and challenging 
		projects that I have worked on. Most radiologists have been trained to 
		view images in the 2D environment. 3D medical imaging offers the enormous 
		potential for <em>fly through</em> user experience where a physician can actually view the 
		reconstructed patient images immersively (very similar to Augmented Reality). 
		One of FiatLux&#39;s 
		main advantages was that it enabled physicians to actually carry a tablet 
		with them and view the patient files on the go. To be successful however we had to address 
		several design problems
		based on user research: </p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding right: 30px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; ">
	How can we create a mobile experience for medical imaging, and empower physicians to view patient files anywhere? How can we present medical images to physicians based on their needs and 
	specialties? For example, how can we filter out medical images for Orthopedic surgeons, Splanchnology, and Neurosurgeons? How can we also ensure that the device can 
	be used for traditional radiology in the 2D environment as well as in 3D?</p>

		<p>The solution was to present the medical imaging in both 2D and in 3D based on 
		user needs. For example, in traditional radiology the physician is 
		mostly&nbsp; 
		interested in viewing a fracture from Front, Back, Left, and Right as shown in my prototype below. He 
		or she could then switch to 3D to get a better sense of a compound 
		fracture for the same patient. A 
		heart surgeon would be able to filter out all other images such as 
		skeletal and view the cardiovascular reconstruction only. A neurosurgeon could view a tumor and print a 3D model of it 
		on a 3D printer.</p>
			<p>As such FiatLux offered an attractive alternative to physicians to view 
			and study medical images without being tied to traditional workstations. </p>

				 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">HP Embedded Server</h4>

		<p>The Embedded Web Server was the most ambitious usability project that I was assigned 
		to at HP. The company executives and project managers were looking for solutions to 
		solve the following problems:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding right: 30px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; ">
	How can we empower our customers to control network laser printers remotely through a browser? 
	How can we alert our laser printer customers that they need to buy supplies 
	and help them automate the ordering process, and as such increase the revenues on printer 
	supplies? How can printers run self-diagnostics and alert the system admins about potential 
	issues? How can HP product support connect to a
	printer remotely and detect device issues to save costs on technical support?</p>
		<p>The answer to many of these usability issues was the Embedded Web
		Server, a revolutionary product that paved the path for 
		using a web browser to access the firmware on a peripheral 
		device and interact with it remotely. 
	This invention 
		also made it far more convenient for the end user 
		to monitor and configure printers on a computer screen rather than using the small and cumbersome 
		control panels on the physical device itself. </p>
	<p>I worked closely with the marketing department to document both user and business requirements. 
	I identified the personas (office users and system admins) and their usage patterns, and designed a 
	role-based user interface that would show or hide options based on user 
	privileges. I created the high-fidelity prototype shown below for user testing and for final handoff to developers. The end result was a quantum leap in ease of use that helped grow both the top line and the bottom line for the company.

<div id="goldcare-section" style="" class="scroll-section" >
	
	 <h4 class=" h4scrollindicator">Boeing GoldCare</h4>
	 
		<p>Boeing GoldCare is one of the most complex and rewarding projects in 
		my career. It challenged me through the entire UCD cycle for a revolutionary product that 
		had never existed before. GoldCare came about with the birth of 
		the Boeing 787 which is revolutionizing the air travel. The 787 does not 
		just provide more fuel efficiency or ease of manufacturing: the 787 also 
		has <em>enabling technologies</em> that can send out real data about the health 
		of the airplane and  its critical parts. Before the 787, Maintenance Repair Organizations 
		around the world had to deal with many unexpected issues that would keep 
		airplanes out of the air and in the hangers for repair. Many airlines 
		were plagued with the following problems that GoldCare aimed to solve: </p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding right: 30px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; ">
	If an airplane experiences a critical issue in flight and needs to be diverted for emergency 
	repairs, can we identify the problem in advance and estimate how long it 
	will take to fix the problem? What replacement 
	parts will be needed or do we need to fly the parts into an airport? What tools will be required to replace the part, and 
	will the airport have them? Will the airport have the skilled technicians to 
	replace the parts or do we have to fly them in? How long reasonably will it take to repair the airplane, and will 
	the passengers have to deplane and will the airline need to provide 
	another flight?</p>
		<p>Boeing GoldCare project was a quantum leap in helping solve those problems. 
		Through the enabling technologies of the 787, parts like engines can send data on 
		their health and the severity of the issue and immediately alert the airlines. As such we could create a 
		system to monitor the health of the aircraft and take action to keep 
		them flying on time. </p>
	<p>My role in the project was pretty challenging. I needed to create a 
	visual design to display where the airplanes were at any given time around 
	the world, which airlines they belonged to, and if there was a problem, what 
	distress signals were being transmitted by the airplane and how to make the data understandable 
	to the repair organizations. I also had to help design 
	an intelligent system to help the operators locate where the nearest parts 
	were located and where to find the qualified technicians to repair the airplane if they were not available at the repair site.</p>
	<p>All this effort largely succeeded due to interviewing the end users 
	regarding their goals and understanding their pain points with the existing 
	workflows, and by involving them throughout the design cycle by using participatory design. </p>
	<p>The project is now being expanded to a new generation of Boeing 
	airplanes such as the 777 that have enabling technologies as well.</p>
	<p>Please note that I cannot share any of my design screens 
	due to the propriety nature of the project, but there is some 
	information on GoldCare that is publicly available which I am including below.</p>
